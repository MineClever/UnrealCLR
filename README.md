UnrealCLR For .net 8 + Unreal 5.3.2


Note:
When try to debug with Unreal C++ sln, make sure you set the unreal project's debugger to support .Net Core, otherwise your pdb won't be loaded ->
Property->Debugging->Debugger Type, set to Mixed (.NET Core)

Debugging with standalone C# sln should be fine.
